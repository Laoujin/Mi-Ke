TODO
====

**Usually this stuff should be posted here:**  
https://github.com/Laoujin/Mi-Ke/issues

Context menu:
Go to special path
- Startup folder: #y::Run c:\path
- My documents
- APP_DATA/roaming
- PowerShell profile?
- Desktop
- downloads
--> configurable?

Need to add instructions on how to add a new shortcut
with all the possible parameters explained.
This would be useful for me aswell...
(wiki page?)


Probably bug that if copied text is too large,
then the file merge stuff doesn't work... ClipWait?



<#b::MsgBox base64
!<#b::Msgbox decode
#<j::MsgBox jwt decode?

;--> finish excel article & publish twitter, linkedIn ...



Roadmap to v1
-------------

Should have screenshots in here...
Releases should include the exe?
Should have forms to edit the ini files before this can be actually useful...
--> But functionality first... Once it has what I need, perhaps look into releasing something?


Other custom libraries
----------------------

https://github.com/theborg3of5/ahk
- "DEBUG" should be activateable
- dateTime.ahk - generate dates / sql server & other dbs, ...
- debug.ahk - generate form with keys pressed etc?
- saveClipboardToFile, readFileToClipboard, 
- Activate a shortcut only on certain machine?
- mainConfig loadSettingFromFile has an IniObject which might be what I need for the hotkeys?
- launch.ahk: openAllSites ..
- screen.ahk: alwaysontop, enable with mouse, hibernate shortcut..., centerWindow, ...
