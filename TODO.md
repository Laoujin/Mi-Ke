**Usually this stuff should be posted here:**

Context menu:
Go to special path
- Startup folder: #y::Run c:\path

Need to add instructions on how to add a new shortcut
with all the possible parameters explained.
This would be useful for me aswell...
(wiki page?)


Roadmap to v1
-------------

Should have screenshots in here...
Releases should include the exe?
Should have forms to edit the ini files before this can be actually useful...
--> But functionality first... Once it has what I need, perhaps look into releasing something?


Other custom libraries

- Activate a shortcut only on certain machine?
- Exactly like my… Lots of interesting stuff to find there probably…
