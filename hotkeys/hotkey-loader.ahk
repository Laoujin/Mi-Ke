; Auto-execute section:
; (Code you want executed at script startup)
#Include %A_Scriptdir%\hotkeys\_auto-execute.ahk

; A place to put your custom scripts:
#Include %A_Scriptdir%\hotkeys\_includes.ahk


; Create _auto-execute.ahk, _includes.ahk and other files required for Mi-Ke to start by running init.ps1


; If you create a script that could be used by others,
; do not put it here! Put it in scripts/amazingapp.ahk
; and create a pull request so that others may benefit
; (like me:)
