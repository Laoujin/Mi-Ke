# TIPS:
# You can find out which Control Panel files (.cpl) are available on your version of Windows by going to c:\Windows\System32. There you find all that are available.
# You may open different tabs directly by adding ,x to the command, e.g. sysdm.cpl,4 to open the System Protection tab of the System Properties control panel applet. This works on the command prompt, but does not on Start or the Run Box.
# You can run applets with elevated privileges by starting them from an elevated command prompt. Hold down Ctrl and Shift on the keyboard when you launch the Command Prompt to do so.
# The canonical names used above may be used to reference these items in the Group Policy.
